    <h1>‘THE ROAD NOT TAKEN’ BY ROBERT FROST (1916)</h1>

    <h2>SECTION 1</h2>
    Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore— While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. “’Tis some
    visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door— Only this and nothing more.”
